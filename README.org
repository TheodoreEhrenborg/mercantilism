#+TITLE: Mercantilism
This is my 12th grade AP research project, where I wrote and tested several algorithms that played a multiplayer board game. See the PDF for more details.
* WARNING
I last worked with this repository in
Spring 2019. When I updated it to Python 3, 
some bug appeared involving the neural network,
but I don't remember what. It's probably best to 
use the python2 branch.

Also, my documentation is pretty bad, so I'm not sure
what some of my code is doing.
