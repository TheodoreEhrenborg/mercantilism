* WARNING
I last worked with this package in 
Spring 2019. When I updated it to Python 3, 
some bug appeared involving the neural network,
but I don't remember what. It's probably best to 
use the python2 branch.

Also, the documentation is pretty bad, so I'm not sure
what some of my code is doing.
